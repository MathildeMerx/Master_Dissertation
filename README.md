Time series prediction are a massive part of finance. Instead of working with the time series themselves, I'll try and use images of them: regular plot, recurrence plot, wavelet transform, Gramian Angular Difference Field...

The tools I'd like to use are: CNN, CapNets, Transformer architecture with attention mechanism,...

The purpose will be: 
  1. to cluster the companies from S&P500 according to different variables (stock price, stock trading volume, beta, market cap,...) and see whether the clusters are the same
  2. to "classify" each company: according to the past 15 days of data, will the stock price increase tomorrow?
